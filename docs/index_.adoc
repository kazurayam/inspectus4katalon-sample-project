* It takes screenshots of the pages, save the images in PNG format. It also save the HTML sources.
* It compiles a report in HTML where you find multiple sets of *Previous* / *Diff* / *Current* images & HTMLs of the web site taken at different timing.
* By Chronos-Diff, you can compare the pages of a single Web site at different timing. You can make sure if your Web application is healthy after certain changes in any portion of software/hardware/network.
